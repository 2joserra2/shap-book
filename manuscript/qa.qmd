# Q&A


## What does option "XXX" for tree mean?


## How to speed up the computation?

There are many tips

- Use TreeSHAP, because much faster than Permutation or Kernel
- Use kmeans or sample for the background data. TODO: check how much
  - shap.kmeans(data, K) 
- For summary plots, use fewer data

## For DeepExplainer, how large should the backgroud data be?

100 is good, 1000 is very good

## What software alternatives are available?

Shapley values are implemented in both the `iml` and [fastshap](https://github.com/bgreenwell/fastshap) packages for R.
In Julia, you can use [Shapley.jl](https://gitlab.com/ExpandingMan/Shapley.jl).

SHAP, an alternative estimation method for Shapley values, is presented in the [next chapter](#shap).
