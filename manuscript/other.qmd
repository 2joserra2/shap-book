# Other Applications of Shapley Values in ML

This chapter takes a step back from the Shapley values for prediction view.
Shapley values are very general and can be used in lots of attribution scnarios



## SAGE: Shapley Additive Global importancE 

Attribute the performance of the model to the individual features.


TODO: Read paper and fill in here


## Attribute performance to instance


##  Decomposition of R-squared

## Data Shapley:

- sample selection method
- before model is trained
- paper: http://proceedings.mlr.press/v97/ghorbani19c.html
