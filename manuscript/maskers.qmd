# Maskers


- Before we dive into other data structures like image and text, we have to talk about maskers
- maskers are a function that defines how coaliations are built
- maskers are the technical solution
- for the following problem: What does it mean for a feature value to be absent?
- because that highly depends on the data type
- for tabular data, absence is about drawing from background data
- for images this can be blurring out parts of the image
- and so on
- and this can be steered by providing maskers
-

List of maskers:

- Independent
- Partition
- Text
- Image


## Independent

- what we already know at this point
- features are just normal input features
- replacement is with background data
- arguments: data, max_samples


## Partition

- for the Partition Explainer
- like Indpendent, requires background data
- arguments: data, max_samples, clustering type
- data: the background data
- max_samples: how often to sample from background data for estimation
- clustering: distance metric for clustering the features


## Text

- For text input
- Tokenizes the text
- level of unit then becomes the token, not the characters.
- unless, of course, you tokenize on character level
- we will talk about this more in the text chapter (LINK)
- TODO: visualize this

## Image

-  for image data
-  masks out parts of the image. not pixels, but bigger portions
- more details in image chapter
- TODO: visualize how it works
