## True to The Data Versus True To The Model

* also framed as understanding versus audit
* 


- However, Tree path dependent is not true to the data as hoped
- see: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0004370221000539


## A Solution: Use the Owen values

- cluster the features
- compute the Shapley values for the clusters
- and recurseively in the clusters
- actually then we have a slightly different game
- And the solution are called Owen values
- changes complexity from $\mathcal{O}(2^p)$ to $\mathcal{O}(p^2)$ (when clustering tree is balanced)
- $p$ is the number of input features to the model

- TODO: can also be used for other use cases then correlatin. maybe move to another chapter?
