- SHAP is model-agnostic, meaning it can be applied to any type of machine learning model.
- It is based on a solid theoretical foundation, which is the concept of Shapley values from cooperative game theory.
- SHAP values are consistent, meaning that if a model relies more on a certain feature, the SHAP value for that feature will be higher.
- SHAP values are locally accurate, ensuring that the sum of the SHAP values for a specific prediction equals the actual prediction.
- They provide a unified measure of feature importance, making it easier to compare the contributions of different features across various models.
- The Python library 'shap' offers a user-friendly implementation and supports various visualization options.
- SHAP values can be used for both global and local explanations, helping to understand the overall importance of features as well as individual predictions.
- SHAP is built on a solid game-theoretic foundation.
- SHAP works for various types of input data: tabular, text, and images.
- SHAP has many good software implementations available in Python and R.
- Designed for local explanations (explaining individual predictions), SHAP explanations can be combined for global model understanding (feature importance, interactions, dependence).
- SHAP received hype, leading to many research papers on extensions for special types of models.
- The hype also means abundant material and blog posts, although repetitive and noisy. Good thing you have this ultimate guide!
- Extensions like shapash enable building dashboards with Shapley values.
- Shapley values are useful beyond explaining predictions, as seen in other machine learning applications. The [Other Applications Chapter](#other) covers use cases ranging from valuing data to fairly attributing feature importance (based on loss function).
