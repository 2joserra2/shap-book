# Building SHAP dashboards with shapash

show example

```{python}
#| eval: false
import sklearn
import shap
import shap.datasets
import shapash
from shapash import SmartExplainer

# Load the California housing dataset from Shap
X,y = shap.datasets.california(n_points=1000)


# Train a model
model = sklearn.linear_model.LinearRegression()

xpl = SmartExplainer(
    model=model
)

xpl.compile(X,model.predict(X), y)

# Create a dashboard
app = shapash.Dashboard(explainer=explainer, title='California Housing Prices')
app.run()

```

In this example, we load the California housing dataset from Shap and train a linear regression model on it. We then create a Shapash explainer, which takes in our trained model, input data, and variables of interest. Finally, we create a dashboard object and run it using the run() method. This will launch a browser window displaying the dashboard, which will allow users to interact with and explore the model's predictions and explanations. The dashboard will display various plots and metrics related to the model's performance, as well as feature importance and partial dependence plots generated by Shapash.
