# Theory of SHAP {#theory}

TODO: Find a way to separate SHAP and Shapley

Keep in mind, you don't need to read this chapter if you only want to use SHAP values.
It's intended for those who want to explore the mathematics behind them.


## Who's Gonna Pay For That Taxi?

For now, forget about machine learning.
To motivate SHAP, we first have to understand Shapley values and will do so with a taxi ride example:
Alice, Bob, and Charlie had dinner together and now hail a taxi to get home.
They discuss what would be a fair way to share these costs of \$51.

Imagine we could know the cost of that ride for all possible combinations of Alice, Bob, and Charlie.
Only Alice takes the ride? That would be \$15.
Even though Alice and Charlie live together, adding Bob to the ride bumps the cost to \$25, because he insists of getting the luxury taxi.
Adding Bob to the Alice and Charlie makes the cost go up to \$51 since the Bob lives a bit further away. 
We can do this for all possible combinations and end up with the following table:


| Passengers           | Costs | Note                                  |
|----------------------|-------|--------------------------------------|
| {}                   |   $0  | No taxi ride, no costs               |
| {Alice}              |   $15 | Normal ride fare to Alice's & Bob's place |
| {Bob}                |   $25 | Bob always insists on getting luxury taxis |
| {Charlie}            |   $38 | Charlie lives a bit further away      |
| {Alice, Bob}         |   $25 | Bob always gets his way               |
| {Alice, Charlie}     |   $41 | Alice & Bob's place requires a slight detour |
| {Bob, Charlie}       |   $51 | Bob requires luxury, even when Charlie is there |
| {Alice, Bob, Charlie}|   $51 | The full fare with all 3 of them      |

This seems like a step in the right direction: With this table we get a first idea how much each person contributes to the cost of the ride.

## Calculating Marginal Contributions For The Taxi Costs

::: {.callout-note}

## Marginal Contribution

The marginal contribution of a player to a coalition is the value of the coalition *with* the player minus the value of the coalition *without* the player.

For the taxi ride example, the marginal contribution of a passenger to a set of other passengers is the cost included this passenger minus the cost excluding this passenger.

:::

But we have to get one step further by calculating the so-called marginal contributions of each person to each combination.
For example, how much additional cost does Alice contribute in the taxi ride together with Bob?

With the help of the table, we can calculate marginal contributions.
We can compare the cost between {Alice,Bob} and {Bob}, which gives us how much Alice contributed to the {Alice,Bob}  taxi ride.
In this case, it's \$25 - \$25 = \$0, since the taxi ride doesn't get more expensive. 
If we calculate the marginal contribution for Bob to {Alice,Bob}, we get \$25 - \$15 = \$10, or in other words, adding Bob to a taxi ride with Alice adds \$10.
See where this is going?
We are going to do this for all possible marginal contributions:

| Adding              | To Coalition     | Cost Before | Cost After | Marginal Contribution |
|---------------------|------------------|-------------|------------|-----------------------|
| Alice             | {}               | $0          | $15        | $15                   |
| Alice             | {Bob}            | $25         | $25        | $0                    |
| Alice             | {Charlie}        | $38         | $41        | $3                    |
| Alice             | {Bob, Charlie}   | $51         | $51        | $0                    |
| Bob               | {}               | $0          | $25        | $25                   |
| Bob               | {Alice}          | $15         | $25        | $10                   |
| Bob               | {Charlie}        | $38         | $51        | $13                   |
| Bob               | {Alice, Charlie} | $41         | $51        | $10                   |
| Charlie           | {}               | $0          | $38        | $38                   |
| Charlie           | {Alice}          | $15         | $41        | $26                   |
| Charlie           | {Bob}            | $25         | $51        | $26                   |
| Charlie           | {Alice, Bob}     | $25         | $51        | $26                   |

Again, feels like one step closer to a possible fair share of the ride costs.
Can we just average those marginal contributions per passenger?
We could, but that would make every marginal contribution get equal weight.
You can however, make the argument that adding, for example, Alice to an empty taxi is more informative than adding Alice to a taxi with Bob.
And this argument is about the order in which we can arrange the passengers.
There are 3!=6 possibilities of ordering the passengers:

- Alice, Bob, Charlie
- Alice, Charlie, Bob
- Bob, Alice, Charlie
- Bob, Charlie, Alice
- Charlie, Alice, Bob
- Charlie, Bob, Alice

## Averaging Marginal Contributions

In two of these cases, Alice was added to an empty taxi, but only in one case to a taxi with only Bob in it.
If we weight the marginal contributions accordingly, we get the following weighted average marginal contribution for Alice.
Taking the liberty to shorten Alice, Bob, and Charlie to A,B and C.

$$\frac{1}{6}(\underbrace{2 \cdot \$15}_{\text{A to }\emptyset} + \underbrace{ 1 \cdot \$0}_{\text{A to B}} + \underbrace{1 \cdot \$3}_{\text{A to C}} + \underbrace{2 \cdot \$0}_{\text{A to B,C}})  = \$5.5$$

We divide by $\frac{1}{6}$ because 6 is the sum of the weights (2 + 1 + 1 + 2).
And that's our final answer for how much Alice should pay to the ride: \$5.5.

Likewise we can calculate the contribution for Bob:

$$\frac{1}{6}(\underbrace{2 \cdot \$25}_{\text{B to }\emptyset} + \underbrace{ 1 \cdot \$10}_{\text{B to A}} + \underbrace{1 \cdot \$13}_{\text{B to C}} + \underbrace{2 \cdot \$10}_{\text{B to A,C}})  = \$15.5$$

And for Charlie:

$$\frac{1}{6}(\underbrace{2 \cdot \$38}_{\text{C to }\emptyset} + \underbrace{ 1 \cdot \$26}_{\text{C to A}} + \underbrace{1 \cdot \$26}_{\text{C to B}} + \underbrace{2 \cdot \$26}_{\text{C to A,B}})  = \$30$$

The individual contributions add up to the total cost: \$5.5 + \$15.5 + \$30 = \$51. Neat.
As you might have guessed, this is the same result as we would get with the approach that is called the Shapley values [@shapley1953value].
The method computing these attributions is called Shapley values, and according to this method, the above would be a fair share of the costs.

We could have made different decision in how we "fairly" attribute the costs to the passengers.
For example, we could have weighted the marginal contributions differently.
We could have just divided the costs by 3.
Or we could use solutions that relies on the order of passengers: Alice alone would pay \$15, when we add Bob it's +\$10, so that's his share and Charlie pays the rest.
A solution which has the problem that would we order the passengers differently, we would get a different share of the costs.

Shapley values are a specific way to attribute the payout to the individual players.
Next chapter, we will explore where Shapley values come from and how exactly they are defined.

## Expressing in terms of game theory

Shapley values are a method from coalitional game theory.
The basic setup is:
There are players who can form a coalition.
They participate in a game that comes with a payout, which should be fairly divided among the players.
Every possible coalition, not only the full one containing all the players will get a certain payout.
How much that is is described by a so-called value function.

Players, coalition, value function, ... a lot of new terms, so here's an overview how it translates to the taxi example:

| Term  | Mathematical symbol | Taxi example |
|-------|---------------------|--------------|
| Player |? | Passenger, for example Alice |
| Coalition | S | Any combination of passengers, for example {Bob, Charlie}. Also valid coalitions are  the full coalition {Alice, Bob, Charlie} and the empty coalition $\emptyset$|
| Size of a coalition | $|S|$ | {Alice} has coaliation size 1, {Alice, Bob, Charlie} has coalition size 3.|
| Total number of players in the game | $N$ |  3 passengers: Alice, Bob, and Charlie|
| Game | | The taxi ride is the "game"|
| Payout | | The cost of the taxi ride |
| Value function | $v()$ | Described by the table with all possible constellation of passengers in the taxi |
|Shapley value | $\phi_j$ | How much each passenger $j$ has to pay in the end. For example $\phi_1=\$5.50$ for Alice, $\phi_2=\$15.50$ for Bob, and $\phi_3=\$30$ for Charlie.|


The value function $v$ is sometimes also called characteristic function.

## How to compute Shapley values

With the taxi ride example, we have already seen an "organic" approach to computing Shapley values.
But let's formalize this with a formula:


$$
\phi_j = \sum_{S \subseteq N \backslash \{j\}} \frac{|S|!(N-|S|-1)!}{N!} (v(S \cup \{j\}) - v(S))
$$ {#eq-shapley} 

The value function $v: P(N) \mapsto \mathbb{R}$ maps from all possible coalitions of N players to a real number which is the payout for this coalition.
The whole formula is quite a handful, so let's break it down.

- $v(S \cup \{j\}) - v(S)$: Let's focus on the core of this equation first. We have already encountered this term: this is the marginal contribution of player $j$ to coalition $S$. If $j$ is Alice, and $S=\{Bob\}$ then this part expresses how much more expensive the ride becomes when Alice joins Bob.
- $\sum_{S \subseteq N \backslash \{j\}}$: The entire formula is a sum over all possible subset that exclude $j$. So if we calculate the Shapley value for Alice, we sum over the following coalitions: $\emptyset$, $\{Bob\}$, $\{Charlie\}$, and $\{Bob, Charlie\}$.
- $\frac{|S|!(N-|S|-1)!}{N!}$: This term, tells us how much to weight a marginal contribution. $\emptyset$ and $N \backslash \{j\}$ get the highest weights. The $|N|!$ in the denominator ensures that the sum of the weights equals 1.

The scary looking formula isn't so scary after all!

::: {.callout-note}

The Shapley value is a weighted average of the marginal contributions of a player across all possible coalitions.

## The axioms behind Shapley values

Okay, now we have the formula, but where did it even come from?
Lloyd Shapley derived it [@shapley1953value], but he didn't just pull it out of thin air.
He formulated axioms of what a fair distribution looked liked and from these axioms, he derived the formula.
And Lloyd Shapley also showed that based on these axioms, his Shapley value formula has a unique solution.

Let's talk about these axioms as they are quite fundamental.
These axioms are **Efficiency**, **Symmetry**, **Dummy**, and **Additivity**.
But we will walk through the axioms, as they have implications for the interpretation of SHAP values as they are Shapley values as well.
And they also justify the use of SHAP values (or why, in some cases, you might not be interested in them).
An axiom is a statement which is regarded as accepted or self-evidently true. 
But you can also interpret the following axioms as a definition of fairness when it comes to payouts in team play.

### Efficiency

The efficiency axioms says that the sum of the contributions must **exactly$$ add up to the payout.
This makes a lot of sense to me.
Imagine Alice, Bob, and Charlie would pick some method to compute their share of the taxi ride, but the end result wouldn't end up to the cost of the taxi ride.
Would be a totally useless method.

The feature contributions must add up to the difference between the prediction for x and the average.

$$\sum_{j \in N}\phi_j = v(N)$$

### Symmetry

If two players are equivalent, then they should receive the same contribution.
Equivalent means that their marginal contributions are the same.
For example, wouldn't Bob require like the luxury version of the taxi, then Bob would have exactly the same marginal contributions like Alice.
And the symmetry axioms then says that both should pay exactly the same in the end.
Sounds fair to me.

We can also express this in more mathematical terms for two players $j$ and $k$:

If $v(S \cup \{j\}) = v(S \cup \{k\})$ for all $S \subseteq N \backslash \{j, k\}$, then $\phi_j = \phi_{k}$.

### Dummy or Null Player

If a player doesn't contribute to any coalition, their Shapley value is zero.
I think that's very fair.
Imagine Charlie has a dog and we see the dog as an extra player.
But the dog doesn't actually change the cost of the taxi ride.
Then the contribution of the dog is \$0.
I think the dummy axiom is fair, especially since dogs usually have no money.

To put it more formally:

If $v(S \cup \{j\}) = v(S)$$ for all $S \subseteq N \backslash \{j\}$, then $\phi_j = 0$.

### Additivity

For a game with two value functions $v_1$ and $v_2$, the Shapley values for the sum of the games can also be expressed as the sum of Shapley values:

$$\phi_{j, v_1 + v_2} + \phi_{j, v_1} + \phi_{j, v_2}$$

Imagine they don't only share the taxi, but also go out eating some ice cream.
And their goal isn't only to fairly share the taxi costs, but both the costs of the taxi and the ice cream.
The additivity axiom says that Alice, Bob, and Charlie could first calculate and share the ice cream costs and then the taxi costs separately.


These four[^fifth] axioms are enough to make the Shapley values unique, meaning there's only one solution which is presented in the Shapley formula, @eq-shapley.
We will not talk about the proof of why this is the case in this book, because it would go too far.


[^fifth]: There is a fifth axiom called *Linearity* or *Marginality*, but this axiom can be derived from the others, so it doesn't add any new idea of what it means to have a fair payout.
