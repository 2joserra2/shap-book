# Extensions of Shapley values {#extensions}


This chapter lists some extensions for Shapley values

These incldue extensions

- for specific tasks
- for special type of data
- etc.



## Group SHAP

- grouping features into multiple groups
- and computing the Shapley value for the groups instead of individual features
- benefits: less costly, can deal with the correlation issue.
- paper applying (and introducing?) group shap: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0957417422014725


## n-Shapley values

- links GAMs and Shapley values
- called n-Shapley values
- n is the interaction depth that can be controlled
- [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2209.04012.pdf)
- [@bordt2022shapley]
- [code: nshap package in Python](https://github.com/tml-tuebingen/nshap)
- n-Shapley values and functional decomposition are related
- Interaction values:
  - Shapley Tayler
  - Faith Shap
- if model to be explained is a GAM, then SHAP recover all the non-linear components, as we have seen in the [additive chapter](#additive).
