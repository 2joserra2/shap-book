# Other books by the author

I have also written another book about Interpretable Machine Learning.
Interpretable Machine Learning covers a wide range of XAI techniques, from counterfactual explanations, ICE curves, and PDPs to Accumulated Local Effect Plots, Permutation Feature Importance, and LIME.
Shapley values and SHAP are also covered in this book.
