# The SHAP library


- from researcher who developed shap
- very famous
- but has lots of problems
- wasn't sure whether to use it or not
- but still the most complete library out there on shap



Some issues as of TODAY (TODO: DATE)

- The author S Lundberg doesn't regularly maintain it. Last commit to main branch was in June 2022.
- tests are failing
- many examples and notebooks don't work any more
- for example, the example right in the README doesn't work any more, because Boston dataset depricated
- the are more than 1.5k unresolved issues (many of the questions, but this also means no triage), also many pull requests open (89) 

Wow, many issues.

- i developed a package myself during PhD (iml)
- so I know it's a lot of work
- and it can be rather unthankful work
- only people complaining that things don't work
- while you get a thanks here and there, it's not like you can live off that
- so this section not meant to be criticism of Scott Lundberg
- Not at all
- whatever time he gives to the community is a gift


- The issues are here because I take on the stance of the user
- who has to make the decision which libraries to rely on
- and which not
- shap is a tough choice to make 
- we have: shap with lots of issues and vanishing maintenance
- then we have many other libraries with much less scope and control


Here is an overview of libraries as alternatives:
