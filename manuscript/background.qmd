# The Role of Background Data


- determines, in combination with maskers, how absence of a feature is simulated
- not only technical
- but is also interesting and important point
- most of the times: use the same distribution as training
- background data defines:
  - the expected prediction which is the contrastive point
  - how absent features are simulated
-



TODO: simulations with CAlifornia data
- all data points as background
- one data point as background
- subset as background
- kmeans as background
-
