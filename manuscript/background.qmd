# The Role of Background Data

Q that SHAP answers: Why did instance get a certain prediction?

This is answered contrastive to a distribution.


Q that SHAP answers: Why did instance get a certain prediction, rather than the average of the background data?

This comes from the background data which serves as reference distribution.

IN theory you could use a single data point.
TODO: Read https://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.13787.pdf

- determines, in combination with maskers, how absence of a feature is simulated
- not only technical
- but is also interesting and important point
- most of the times: use the same distribution as training
- background data defines:
  - the expected prediction which is the contrastive point
  - how absent features are simulated
-



TODO: simulations with CAlifornia data
- all data points as background
- one data point as background
- subset as background
- kmeans as background
-    

Special situations:

- Tree Explainer with feature_pertubation="tree_path_dependent"


Background data often assumed to be with independent features.

Next chapter let's look at correlations and alternatives for the shapley values.
