# Alternatives to the `shap` library

There are alternative implementations of `shap` and SHAP values available.

In Python:

- [Captum](https://github.com/pytorch/captum)[@kokhlikyan2020captum]: A general model interpretability library that implements KernelShap, Sampling estimator, GradientShap, and Deep Shap.
- [shapley](https://github.com/benedekrozemberczki/shapley)[@rozemberczki2022shapley]: Implements the exact estimator, some linear explanation methods, and Monte Carlo permutation sampling.

Python packages that internally rely on `shap`:

- [DALEX](https://github.com/ModelOriented/DALEX)[@baniecki2021dalex]
- [AIX360](https://github.com/Trusted-AI/AIX360)[@aix360sept2019]
- [InterpretML](https://github.com/interpretml/interpret/)[@nori2019interpretml] covers multiple methods, including shap.
- [OmnixAI](https://github.com/salesforce/OmniXAI)[@wenzhuo2022omnixai], a library for explainable AI
- [shapash](https://github.com/MAIF/shapash) for dashboards and reports, covered in [this chapter](#dashboard).

In R:

- [DALEX](https://github.com/ModelOriented/DALEX)[@biecek2018dalex]
- [kernelshap](https://github.com/ModelOriented/kernelshap)
- [shapr](https://github.com/NorskRegnesentral/shapr)[@Sellereite2019]
- [ShapleyR](https://github.com/redichh/ShapleyR)
- [shapper](https://github.com/ModelOriented/shapper), relying on the Python shap package.
- [shapviz](https://github.com/ModelOriented/shapviz) implements many SHAP plots from the original Python `shap` package and more.
- [treeshap](https://github.com/ModelOriented/treeshap)
- [iml](https://github.com/christophM/iml)[@molnar2018iml]
