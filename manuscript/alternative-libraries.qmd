# Alternatives to the `shap` Library

Several alternative implementations of `shap` and SHAP values are available.

In Python:

- [Captum](https://github.com/pytorch/captum)[@kokhlikyan2020captum]: A comprehensive model interpretability library, providing KernelShap, Sampling estimator, GradientShap, and Deep Shap implementations.
- [shapley](https://github.com/benedekrozemberczki/shapley)[@rozemberczki2022shapley]: Offers the exact estimator, several linear explanation methods, and Monte Carlo permutation sampling.

Python packages that utilize `shap` internally:

- [DALEX](https://github.com/ModelOriented/DALEX)[@baniecki2021dalex]
- [AIX360](https://github.com/Trusted-AI/AIX360)[@aix360sept2019]
- [InterpretML](https://github.com/interpretml/interpret/)[@nori2019interpretml] encompasses multiple methods including shap.
- [OmniXAI](https://github.com/salesforce/OmniXAI)[@wenzhuo2022omnixai], a library dedicated to explainable AI.
- [shapash](https://github.com/MAIF/shapash), designed for dashboards and reports, as discussed in [this chapter](#dashboard).

In R:

- [DALEX](https://github.com/ModelOriented/DALEX)[@biecek2018dalex]
- [kernelshap](https://github.com/ModelOriented/kernelshap)
- [shapr](https://github.com/NorskRegnesentral/shapr)[@Sellereite2019]
- [ShapleyR](https://github.com/redichh/ShapleyR)
- [shapper](https://github.com/ModelOriented/shapper), which depends on the Python shap package.
- [shapviz](https://github.com/ModelOriented/shapviz) reproduces many SHAP plots from the original Python `shap` package and includes additional ones.
- [treeshap](https://github.com/ModelOriented/treeshap)
- [iml](https://github.com/christophM/iml)[@molnar2018iml].
