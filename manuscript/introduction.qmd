# Introduction

<!-- Motivation for XAI -->
Machine learning models are everywhere, and are powerful tools.
However, one big problem is that they are not interpretable.
So it's unclear why a certain prediction was made, and what general factors are that are important to the decision of such a model.

<!-- Along comes XAI -->
A solution to this problem are methods from the field of explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) or interpretable machine learning (IML).
Many methods have been developed.
But one general "class" of methods stand out: Model-agnostic interpretation methods.
These can be applied to any model.

<!-- SHAP -->
And among these model-agnostic interpretation methods, one has become very popular, Shapley values, sometimes also referred to SHAP. [^difference-shap-shapley]
Shapley values or SHAP is a method to explain the predictions of black box machine learning models.
The popularity of Shapley values has good reasons:

- Various good software implementation are available, in Python and in R
- A rich world of interpretation: Not only can Shapley values explain individual predictions, but also say how important a feature was, and 
- Rich ecosystem: Lots of research and other contributions such as Dashboards with Shapley values and so on.


<!-- applications -->

Wide ranging applications already:

- TODO: find more examples, especially from industry
